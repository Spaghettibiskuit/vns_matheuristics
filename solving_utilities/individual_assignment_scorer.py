        Each assignment is of the form (project_id, group_id, student_id).

        The score consists of the following:
        - The student's preference for the project
        - The number of mutual pairs in the group that the student is part of times the reward for
            a mutual pair divided by 2, since the reward is divided among each pair.
        - The penalty for additional groups the project has to supervise divided by the number of
            students in the project.
        - The penalty for deviation from the ideal group size divided by the number of students in
            the group

        This way, the sum of individual assignment scores minus the penalty for unassigned students
        equals the objective.
