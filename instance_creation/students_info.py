    Args:

        num_students: The number of students in the problem instance.
        num_partner_preferences: The number of partner preferences
            each student specifies with the ID of the students he/she
            wants to  work together with the most.
        percentage_reciprocity: Roughly the probability that a student
            specifies another student as a partner preference if that
            student specified him/her as a partner preference before.
        percentage_project_preference_overlap: To what degree the
            student's preference value for a specific project is the
            average preference for that project among those that are
            partner preferences and already have specified their
            project preferences.
        min_project_preference: The lowest possible project preference.
        max_project_preference: The highest possible project preference.

    Returns:
        The project preferences for all projects and the partner preferences
        i.e., the students a student wants to work with the most, for all
        students in the problem instance. Project preferences and partner preferences
        are influenced by each other to a specifiable degree. Otherwise values
        are random within bounds set by the arguments. THE INDEX POSITION IN THE
        DATAFRAME LATER BECOMES THE STUDENT'S ID.
